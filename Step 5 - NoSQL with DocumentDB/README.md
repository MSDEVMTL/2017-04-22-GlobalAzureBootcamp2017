# Goal
Preserve the sentiment analysis obtained in Step4 and persist it in a DocumentDB. We will also add an additional web page to show the results of our previously processed messages. This will show the basic usage of DocumentDB using the .NET SDK.

# Reference
* [DocumentDB documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/documentdb/)
* [DocumentDB bindings with Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-documentdb)

# Some background
Head to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/documentdb/documentdb-get-started for a simple "getting started".

# Let's code!
## Add the DocumentDB
In the Azure portal, click on new and search for "DocumentDB". 

![alt text][img1]

Create a DocumentDB and place it within your existing resource group

![alt text][img2]

Copy the PRIMARY KEY and URI and save them for later

![alt text][img3]

Select the "Add Collection" button accessible from the overview pane of the DocumentDB.

![alt text][img4]

Create the collection and database. Make sure that you used these names as these are reused later on. Also, select the smaller size configuration to minimize costs.

## Update the Function's settings
Return to the function that was created in the previous step. Click on the "Integrate" section and then create a new output (top right corner). Select the Azure DocumentDB Document output.

Configure the output as shown here. In the DocumentDB account connection field, you will have to select "New" to create a connection with your previously created DocumentDB account.

## Add missing nuget packages
Since our web app will be consomming data from DocumentDB, we will need to add the nuget package for the .Net DocumentDB SDK. 
* Right click on the WebApp project and select "Manage Nuget Packages..."
* Go in the browse tab and search for DocumentDB
* Install the latest version of the package Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB

## Create the sentiment analysis model
Ask the attendees to open the file SentimentAnalysisModel.txt.txt in the Code Snippets/Function folder.  Copy the content outside of the function definition to use it as our output.

## Update the signature of the Function
Ask the attendees to open the file FunctionSignature.txt in the Code Snippets/Function folder.  Add this parameters to the signature of the function.

## Output our sentiment analysis model
Ask the attendees to open the file OutputModel.txt in the Code Snippets/Function folder.  Add this at the very and of the main function.

## Update the AppSettings of the WebApp

### If running locally
Ask the attendees to copy the file Web.Deployment.config in the Code Snippets/WebApp folder to the root of the WebApp project and add it to the project in Visual Studio.

* Update the Web.Config to reference that file
```
<appSettings file="Web.Deployment.config">
    ...
</appSettings>
```
* Update the Web.Deployment.config file with your DocumentDB URI and key for example:
```
<appSettings>
  <add key="DocumentDBUri" value="https://dchdocdb.documents.azure.com:443/" />
  <add key="DocumentDBKey" value="myveryprivatekeygoeshere==" />
</appSettings>
```
### If running on Azure

Ask the attendees to go the Application Settings of the WebApp which was deployed previously.

Ask the attendeeds to Update the settings to include the DocumentDB URI and key.

## Update the WebApp to add our new view

* In Visual Studio, ask the attendees to create a Sentiment folder under the View folder and copy the file ViewSentimentAnalysis.cshtm from the Code Snippets/WebApp folder

* In Visual Studio, ask the attendees to copy the file SentimentAnalysisModel.cs from the Code Snippets/WebApp folder to the Models folder

* In Visual Studio, ask the attendees to copy the file SentimentController.cs from the Code Snippets/WebApp folder to the Controllers folder

* In Visual Studio, ask the attendees to create a Repositories folder at the root of the project and copy the file SentimentAnalysisRepository.cs from the Code Snippets/WebApp folder

* Ask the attendees to update the file "Views\Shared\_Layout.cshtml" to add a reference to our new View. 

```
<li>@Html.ActionLink("Home", "Index", "Home")</li>
<li>@Html.ActionLink("Create message", "CreateMessage", "Queue")</li>
```
Becomes:
```
<li>@Html.ActionLink("Home", "Index", "Home")</li>
<li>@Html.ActionLink("Create message", "CreateMessage", "Queue")</li>
<li>@Html.ActionLink("Sentiment analysis", "ViewSentimentAnalysis", "Sentiment")</li>
```

Load your web app and navigate to the new page to view your sentiment analysis results!
